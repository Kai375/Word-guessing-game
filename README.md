# Word guessing game

Word guessing game project. Made with java.

# Game description:

* The computer selects a random word from a word buffer and displays a series of lines as the length of the word. Each line represents one letter.

* The user tries to guess the word by choosing one letter from the alphabet in each turn. If the letter appears in the word, then it will be displayed in its appropriate place in the series     of lines. If the letter appears in more than one place, it appears wherever it appears.

* The user continues to guess letter by letter until he guesses the entire word.

* Finally, the user will be presented with a number of guesses and allowed to start a new game.

* The user interface is implemented using standard I/O that includes the following elements:
 
     * The word that needs to be guessed (initially represented as a series of lines).
 
     * A string representing the letters of the alphabet that have not yet been selected.
 
     * The user enters the selected letter (from the letters that have not yet been selected). In case the user enters an invalid input, the program will display an appropriate message.

* END OF READ ME.
